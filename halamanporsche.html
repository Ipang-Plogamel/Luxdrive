        <h2>Awal Mula & Perjalanan Lamborghini</h2>
        <p>
          Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. was founded in 1963 through the vision of an Italian entrepreneur, Ferruccio Lamborghini
          . Before that, Ferruccio had already achieved success in the tractor manufacturing industry. However, his ambitions went far beyond agricultural machinery. With strong determination,
           he sought to create a sports car that could rival Ferrari—not only in terms of performance, but 
          also in comfort and luxury. From this vision was born a brand that has since become a global icon.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1966, Lamborghini introduced the Miura, a car that is often referred to as the world’s first supercar.
Its revolutionary design, mid-positioned V12 engine, and outstanding performance made the Miura an automotive legend.
Innovation continued with the Countach in the 1970s, which brought a futuristic design with Lamborghini’s signature scissor doors.
This bold design philosophy is what makes Lamborghini always different and the center of attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next era marked the birth of another legendary model: <strong>Diablo</strong> in the 1990s, 
          which became a symbol of power and extreme speed. Then <strong>Murciélago</strong> in the early 2000s, 
          bringing Lamborghini into the modern era with more advanced technology. In 2011, <strong>Aventador</strong> 
          was launched with a fierce V12 engine and an aggressive design that combined cutting-edge technology with sharp aesthetics. 
          Meanwhile, <strong>Huracán</strong> became the more "friendly" V10 model, 
          yet still delivered extraordinary performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lamborghini does not stop at performance alone. The philosophy of <em>“Form Follow Function”</em> remains inherent, 
          where every line of the car’s design is not only for aesthetics, but also for aerodynamics and efficiency. 
          Each model is a fusion of art, technology, and passion. This is what makes Lamborghini more than just a car—it is 
          a lifestyle statement and a symbol of extreme luxury.
        </p>
        <p>
          Memasuki era modern, Lamborghini terus beradaptasi dengan teknologi masa depan. 
          Konsep mobil hybrid dan elektrik mulai diperkenalkan tanpa mengorbankan identitas khasnya: 
          desain tajam, suara mesin yang menggema, serta pengalaman berkendara penuh adrenalin. 
          Lamborghini tetap menjadi nama besar yang mewakili keberanian, kecepatan, dan inovasi tanpa batas.
        </p>
